# Applied Data Science Capstone – IBM

This repository contains the final project for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate offered on Coursera.

📌 Project Description
The goal of this project is to apply the data science skills and techniques learned throughout the previous courses in a real-world scenario. The project focuses on location-based data analysis and the application of clustering algorithms to solve a business problem using geospatial data.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
- Scikit-learn
- Foursquare API

🎯 Project Objectives
- Collect and process geographical data (e.g., for the city of Toronto).
- Analyze and cluster neighborhoods based on venue data using K-Means clustering.
- Visualize clusters using interactive maps.
- Generate insights to support location-based business decision-making.

📊 Outcome
The project results in an interactive map showing clustered neighborhoods and an analysis report that can be used to support decisions such as choosing an optimal location for a business based on surrounding venues and characteristics.
